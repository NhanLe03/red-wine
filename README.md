**Abstract**

Providing a rating table for red wine and uses machine learning algorithms to identify the quality of wine.

**Steps**

Data visualization by seaborn, matplotlib, plotly

Pre-processing Steps for Machine Learning:
- Splitting the data
- Feature Scaling
- Handling Imbalanced

Apply machine learning algorithm: 
- Decision Tree(DT)
- Random Forest(RF)

And some clustering algorithm: 
- K-Mean
- Hierarchical Clustering(HAC)
- Density-Based Clustering(DBSCAN)
- Mean Shift
